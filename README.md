{
    void Start()
    {
        string path = "path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx";
        using (FileStream file = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
        {
            IWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(file);
            ISheet sheet = workbook.GetSheetAt(0);
            IRow row = sheet.GetRow(0);
            ICell cell = row.GetCell(0);
            Debug.Log(cell.StringCellValue);

        ISheet sheet = workbook.CreateSheet("Sheet1");
        IRow row = sheet.CreateRow(0);
        ICell cell = row.CreateCell(0);
        cell.SetCellValue("Hello, NPOI!");

        using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
